# ![Kumo small logo](https://github.com/Zaczero/Kumo/blob/master/images/KumoSmall.png) Kumo - DDoS mitigation

Kumo is a project started in order to provide a free, open-sourced and reliable solution in DDoS mitigation.

While creating Kumo I was thinking about it as a better alternative to *fail2ban* software.
*fail2ban* is great in blocking abusing users at a small scale but when there are thousands of requests per seconds it starts to struggle quite a lot with CPU spiking to 90%-98% and basically killing the server.
Kumo in the same scenario can keep the CPU usage around 1%-5% and it has some nice bonus features like enabling Under Attack Mode in Cloudflare.

### üî¥ Requirements

* .NET Core 2.2
* Cloudflare
* Linux server
* Nginx

### üë®‚Äçüíª How it works

A basic infographic to better visualise what's going on under the hood.  
Please keep in mind that this is a very simplified example.

### üé° Features

* Lightweight & fast
* Supports both IPv4 and IPv6
* Mitigates both Layer7 *(HTTP)* DoS and DDoS attacks
* Enables Cloudflare Under Attack Mode when massive DDoS is detected *(optional)*

### üèÅ Installation

1. Install [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/ubuntu18-04/runtime-2.2.0) on your machine
2. [Download latest Kumo release](https://github.com/Zaczero/Kumo/releases/latest) and unzip it
3. Make sure you are fine with where Kumo files are located *(you won't be able to move it without full reinstallation)*
4. Open Kumo installation directory *(so you can see Kumo.dll etc. files after executing `ls` command)*
5. Make `install-service.sh` file executable using `sudo chmod +x install-service.sh` command
6. And then execute it with `sudo ./install-service.sh`
7. Configure Kumo by editing `config.json` file *([documentation](#documentation))*
8. Configure Nginx to work with Kumo *([tutorial](#configuring-nginx))*
9. Test your configuration with `dotnet Kumo.dll` command *(Ctrl+C to exit)*
10. Start service by running `sudo systemctl start kumo`

### üîß Configuring Nginx

1. First of all make sure that the `nginx -s reload` command is working properly
2. Edit the Nginx configuration `nginx.conf` file and add the following line `include /etc/nginx/snippets/kumo.conf;`
   *(path must be the same as *NginxBlockSnippetFile* from Kumo `config.json` file)*
3. Double-check that you have configured [Nginx rate limiting](https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/) properly
   and that you are getting [user's real ip](https://www.mysterydata.com/how-to-get-the-real-ip-address-using-cloudflare-and-nginx-cwp-centos-web-panel/) from the Cloudflare header
   *([latest Cloudflare IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/))*
